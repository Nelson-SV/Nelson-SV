👋 Hey there, I’m Nelson!  
🎓 Final-year Computer Science student at EASV, Denmark — exploring software development & cybersecurity.  
💻 Currently working with Java, TypeScript, React, .NET — and channeling my inner Mr. Robot in Kali Linux.  
🔐 Passionate about securing systems, defending against threats, and building cool things.  
☕ Powered by curiosity, fueled by coffee, and always chasing the next bug, exploit, or missing semicolon.
